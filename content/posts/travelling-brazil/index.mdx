Travel Tips for Brasil
## What is this?
- In 2019 I lived in Sao Paulo, and I am now travelling 2 times a year to Sao Paulo to visit friends and family. Living and travelling in Brazil has taught me a lot about Latin America.
## Why travel to Brazil?
- *A lot to discover!* Brazil is the biggest country in Latin and South America, the capital is Brasilia (a city built for the government), the biggest city is Sao Paulo (around 16mil inhabitants), and the most famous city is Rio de Janeiro (home of the famous Christ the Redeemer statue). 
- *Amazing Weather!* The weather and climate in Brazil is basically very warm and tropical all year around. Especially, in the North-East of Brazil, which is closer to the equator, the weather is hot all year around. Where cities like Recife are famous for its beaches. 
- *Dreamy Beaches!* Aside from the beautiful climate, Brazil has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, where you find lots of opportunities for surfing and discovering the amazing nature.
- *Culture, fun, party!* People are very open-minded and very friendly towards Europeans in general. Brazilian culture is famous for its carnival, a fanatic soccer culture (where brazilian world cup games are considered a public holiday), and an unique connection to live music (especially Samba, Jazz, and Blues).
- *Yummy food!* Brazilian cuisine has deep roots, and makes use of the unique fruits from the Amazonas. There are a lot of new dishes that you will not find in Europe. Dishes like Açaí, Tapioca, Feijoada, or the small Salgados are all very unique and delicious. 

## Stuff to keep in mind
- *Safety and security?* Most frequent question about travelling in Brasil for Europeans is whether its safe to travel – the answer really depends on what you want to experience. Brasil is a third world country, there is a massive gap between the rich and the poor, the majority of people are struggling to live a life regarding the most basic needs. Therefore, you should watch out for expensive jewelry and expensive phones, when you are not in a rich area of a city. 
    - Sao Paulo is the commercial and financial center of Brazil. The closer you get to the city center the more expensive and rich it becomes. You find the most expensive restaurants and the most exclusive shopping centers. In those parts of the city there is a different level of police presence and protection. On the other hand, the closer you get to the old downtown SP or the outskirts of the city you have to be careful when walking the streets. Here its recommended to travel with Uber from place to place, and to not take out your phone in public. 
    - Rio de Janeiro is the most famous tourist destination of Brazil. There are more pickpockets but also the Favelas (Ghettos) are spread throughout the city itself. Meaning you can walk from a safe neighborhood straight into a Favela without much of a transition. This can be dangerous and you should try to stay out of the Favelas. 
    - In general, try to not walk home when it's dark. Do not wave around your phone in public. And try to stay out of dangerous neighborhoods.
- *Winter can be cold!* However, in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the weather can go below 10ºC in Winter (which is from May to August) in general the climate is also more cloudy and has more rain. During this time of the year I would recommend going to the north-east.
- *Only a small percentage speaks English.* Brazilian Portuguese is a latin language and very close to Spanish, Italian, and French. If you speak any of those languages you should be able to navigate Brasil very easily. However, if you only rely on English try to do you research upfront and do not rely on other people pointing you in the right direction.

## So what?
- If you are up for an adventure and you want to explore Latin America with its beautiful nature and stunning beaches go visit Brazil.
