1. **Measure & Define** Success is the only way you can tell how you are doing and whether you are improving.
2. **Analyze your Data** and isolate the problem you have. This will ultimately prioritize your product roadmap
3. **Add or Scrap Features** Your new feature launches should be tested against a control group. If your feature is not adding then scrap it.  

### Measure & Define Success

At Lounging Bear we built an eCommerce platform for custom-made, high-quality sofas. ECommerce solutions seem pretty straight forward: You need to make the users buy your stuff. 
We used Magento to build our platform (eCommerce standard software). Right out of the box Magento offers a broad range of features (e.g., content management, newsletters, etc.). More features than we would ever need. The problem is that the more features you offer the greater the interplay between them. This complexity not only slows down your product development process but also puts adverse cognitive load on users. Typically, the motivation behind this is the assumption that users expect these features. This hunch gets confirmed as you see competitors sporting the same features. The consequence is that a lot of time is wasted on the wrong features at the wrong time. For a nascent platform, in an existing market, it is important to be fast and to adapt quickly to the needs of the users. Instead of aiming for feature parity with competitors, the design of the user journey should be focused on what users really need and then incrementally add value. 

A good product development process should, therefore, be guided by success metrics. Success metrics (or key performs indicators) reflect how well your population of users are achieving their goals (e.g., buying stuff). To define success metrics, it is important to first focus on the user goals and what specific needs the users have. For example, a success metric for a sofa eCommerce platform could be the user-catalog-fit.
 
<div style="font-style: italic;display: flex;flex-direction: row; justify-content: center; align-items: center">
user-catalog-fit =
<div style="margin-left: 8px; display: flex;flex-direction: column; ">
<div style="border-bottom: 1px #000 solid;">users on the catalog page that click on a sofa model</div>
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row; justify-content: center">users on the catalog page</div></div></div> 


If your selection is not converting enough users (e.g., only 10% or less) you need to work on this, because it makes every subsequent step much harder. Further, this metric can help you to identify the models which are most trafficked by users and you can investigate how these models differ from the models which nobody clicks on. It is important to focus on the values that your customers really care about. Define your metrics based on a framework that reflects your user journey. For example, in eCommerce, a very established and well-known model is the Attention → Interest → Desire → Action (AIDA) framework, which describes the stages that a user typically undergoes before he finally takes action (see Figure 1). The user-catalog-fit metric would be assigned to the interest stage as the user already spends attention and got to the catalog. He is now seemingly interested in the selection but has not yet stated any desire. The AIDA framework is very universal and is basically applicable for any transaction-based business model. Nevertheless, there is, of course, a plethora of already established frameworks (e.g., from research on information systems) and you can also always come up with a custom framework. 

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row; justify-content: center; align-items: center">
<div style=" width:160px;min-height:120px;display: flex;flex-direction: column; border: 1px #000 solid;justify-content: center;align-items: center">
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;align-items: center;color:#808080">ATTENTION</div>
<div>Lead-Quality</div>
</div>
<div style="width:160px;min-height:120px;display: flex;flex-direction: column; border: 1px #000 solid;justify-content: center; border-left:0;align-items: center">
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;align-items: center;color:#808080">INTEREST</div>
<div>User-Catalog-Fit</div>
</div>
<div style="width:160px;min-height:120px;display: flex;flex-direction: column; border: 1px #000 solid;justify-content: center; border-left:0;align-items: center">
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;align-items: center;color:#808080">DESIRE</div>
<div>Product-Config-Rate</div>
</div>
<div style="width:160px;min-height:120px;display: flex;flex-direction: column; border: 1px #000 solid;justify-content: center; border-left:0;align-items: center">
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;align-items: center;color:#808080">ACTION</div>
<div>Conversion-Rate</div>
</div>
</div>

### Analyze your data

One of the biggest problems in product management is to decide which feature to launch next and where to invest resources. Thus, product managers need measurement tools to get quantified insights from their products. There is also always the opportunity to conduct hands-on user tests and user interviews. Although its difficult to get feedback from a representative sample. This is an extremly important aspect of designing of product design: Product decisions and feature prioritization should be based on feedback from representative people.

In this respect, data helps you to isolate problems and to quantify where you have performance issues. Let’s say your user-catalog-fit metric is not performing good, one reason could be that there are just not the right products dispayed, it could be the order of the products, or it could be the product images. There are a lot of reasons why your users might be scared away. You should write down each of these hypothesis try to think of ways how you could test whether they are true or not. Exclusion will then help you to figure out what iss the real problem. If possible reach out to the users and try to ask them what the issue is. 

### Add or Scrap Features

A/B testing has recently become very popular. Though a common misconception is that A/B testing is only adding value if you have to optimize the colour of a button or you have run two designs against each other. The beauty of digital products and web platforms is that you can update your product without requiring the user to take action. You can deliver indefinite versions of products to different users for no extra cost. You can use this adventegeous nature of web products to gain insights from your users’ behavior. The simplest form experimenting is to launch your new feature only to one half of your users and leave the other half using the former version. By comparing the success metrics of both groups you will be able to get a decisive answer whether your feature is improving the status quo or not. You can easily conduct a t-test to determine whether the difference is significant (http://www.abtestcalculator.com/). 

If your feature is not improving the status quo and does not have a big enough effect on the success metric then you should drop the feature. During product development you should not love features or specific solutions but you should aim to move the needle and help your users. Not every feature you launch is just helping the user. Further, the more features you have the more convoluted your experience and the more your users have to think to make a decision. The real added value of experimenting with two versions of a website is that you can incrementally add real value to a product.
