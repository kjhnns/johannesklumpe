![The Brand Gap](./splash.jpg)

The following insights were the highlights of the book “The Brand Gap” by Marty Neumeier to me. I think many of the book’s lessons also apply to startups and companies that struggle to build a successful product. Especially the pieces about how to innovate and differentiate are essential for product success. Moreover, I liked the part about how to validate great ideas and how to validate your hypotheses. I really agree with the methodology of concept testing and the principle of quick and dirty experimenting.

- A brand is not about what a company says about itself but rather how people perceive the brand. A brand is not a logo or a particular color but rather the immaterial gut feeling people get about the company when they recognize it.
- Brand management is the management of how to differentiate from your competition. Which highlights that be clear about what makes you unique in the market. A brand is like a platonic ideal.
- The brand is important for evaluating the market cap of a company but not for everyday business decisions. Brand value never appears on the balance sheet of a company. This highlights that there is still a gap in understanding how valuable a successful brand is.
- The brand gap is defined as the gap between a company’s business strategy and creativity.
- A brand is based on the question of why a customer should buy companies’ products. In an information-rich but time-poor society, people want to make their decisions based on gut feeling.
- The five disciplines of branding are to differentiate, to collaborate, to innovate, to validate, and to cultivate.
- The need for differentiation is that humans perceive differences as beautiful and like to think in dichotomies. Therefore, a strong brand can differentiate from other brands very distinctively. Moreover, competition enforces the specialization where it is better to be the champion in a small category than to be number three in a large one. When you are number one in a category, you get 1) higher margins and 2) lower risk of commoditization.
- The evolution of marketing has led from a marketing focused on features, marketing focused on benefits, marketing focused on experience, and marketing focused on identification (i.e., trying to make marketing more personal).
- You can destroy a brand by basically diluting your differentiator. When a brand starts to offer products in a new category, then it is harvesting its brand through line extension while losing its differentiator. For example, when Volvo began to introduce faster cars, they diluted their brand built around the promise to deliver safe cars. When Porsche started to offer laptops, it became a brand that not only stands for fast cars. So the customers get confused as the brand does not stand for an individual characteristic anymore.
- Principle for innovation: Innovation is defined as doing something that scares everyone. You should try to be a daring brand that is trying to push the limits. You need to overcome the fear of stupid (e.g., Volkswagen beetle”).
- Criteria for a good name: Distinctiveness, brevity, appropriateness, easy spelling and pronunciation, likability, extendibility, protectability.
- Focus groups and quantified experiments are support functions. They can help you to confirm or falsify hypotheses, but you should never look for inspiration or innovation in quantified experiments.
- Don’t start to milk your experiments for insights when the sample size gets big. It is almost as if you want to increase the value you draw from an experiment not based on the facts but rather on the money you spent, almost like a sunk cost fallacy.
- Hawthorne effect: When subjects behave differently because they know they are part of an experiment. To overcome this effect you should observe in the field.
- The best studies are quick and dirty. Do not fall victim to analysis paralysis. Try to concept tests, where you create up to 7 prototypes and investigate how people react to it. These experiments cost little and yield results. They are not meant to be conclusive or statistically significant but rather to optimize learnings and generate insights fast.
- Don’t worry, be crappy. Consistency is not the most important factor for a brand. A brand is like a person and to err is human. Hence, you should not worry about your consistency.
