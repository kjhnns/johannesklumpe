My name is Johannes Klumpe and I am interested in Product Management, Software Engineering, Digital Nudging, Information Privacy, and User Experience Design. 

I previously worked for [Qualifyze](https://www.Qualifyze.com/) and [Lounging Bear](https://loungingbear.com/). I have a Ph.D. in behavioral economics and wrote my thesis about [social nudges in privacy choice environments](https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/12843/). You can find further information about my resume on LinkedIn.
